Welcome to Prime Minister Trivia!

If you were wondering anything about UK's prime ministers, like the answer to these two questions was:

1. How old is Tony Blair?

2. Where was David Cameron born?

then you can simply deploy the primeMinisters.war into your normal application server(I used Tomcat 7).

At this point you can view the aswers accesing these urls:

1. http://localhost:8080/primeMinisters/primeMinisters/ageOf/Tony%20Blair
   http://localhost:8080/primeMinisters/primeMinisters/answerQuestion/How%20old%20is%20Tony%20Blair%3F

2. http://localhost:8080/primeMinisters/primeMinisters/birthPlaceOf/David%20Cameron
   http://localhost:8080/primeMinisters/primeMinisters/answerQuestion/Where%20was%20David%20Cameron%20born%3F

You can replace the names with any other UK prime minister of your choosing.

You can also find the source files of this project in primeMinisters.zip.
