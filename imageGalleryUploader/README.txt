Welcome to the Image Gallery Importer!

This is a great place for uploading your images to our gallery.

With your continuous support we will be able to store the gallery in a document database like Apache Jackrabbit and even provide basic validation.
So please take advantage of our open source policy and modify the source code.

For the moment the application requires you to have the MongoDB service running.
We strive to assure a comfortable journey through our site so we are happy to announce 100% quality control on our services.


To get your application up and running enter this in the command line in the current directory: 
mvn spring-boot:run

Now you can access the application in your favorite browser at http://localhost:8080/upload .

From there you can upload a range of supported image formats with related metadata.

With your help we can get to a picture perfect future.
